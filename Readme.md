# üë®‚Äçüíª Tech stack

Here's a brief high-level overview of the tech stack the Well app uses:

- This project uses the [React Js](https://flutter.dev/).  declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React allows for the development of reusable UI components, making it easier to maintain and scale the application.
- This project uses the [Material UI](https://flutter.dev/). Material-UI is a React UI framework that follows the principles of Google's Material Design. It provides a set of customizable components for building visually appealing and responsive user interfaces.
- This project uses the [Axios](https://flutter.dev/).  Webpack is a powerful bundler that is used to bundle and manage the project's assets. It simplifies the deployment process by optimizing and bundling various assets such as JavaScript, CSS, and images.
- This project uses the [Python](https://flutter.dev/).  Webpack is a powerful bundler that is used to bundle and manage the project's assets. It simplifies the deployment process by optimizing and bundling various assets such as JavaScript, CSS, and images.

## App Details

Project Overview
This project involves building a complex web application with a user-friendly UI based on a provided Figma design. The frontend is developed using ReactJs, and the backend is implemented using Python
Frontend: ReactJs
Backend: Choose one from Java, Python, or Nodejs
UI Design
The UI design is based on the provided Figma design, which can be found here. The goal is to closely resemble the Figma design in terms of layout, colors, fonts, and components for the entire UI, excluding the Graph Component.

Graph Component
Dataset
The Graph Component represents the relationship between profit percentage and time using a large dataset. The dataset can be found here. 
It consists of two columns: Timestamp and corresponding Profit Percentage, totaling 69,681 rows.

Implementation
Interactive Graph:

The graph should be interactive, allowing users to explore the data dynamically.
Downsampling Algorithm:

Due to the dataset's size, directly plotting all data points on a single graph may lead to performance issues. Therefore, an efficient downsampling algorithm is required.
